ABSTRACT
*This project focuses on Information Retrieval (IR) techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) through a Question Answering (QA) System.
• The system utilizes deep learning models, specifically BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers), for extracting precise answers.
• It retrieves information from both structured and unstructured data sources.
• Key IR techniques implemented: Document indexing – Organizing data for efficient retrieval.Query processing – Interpreting and refining user queries .
• The system leverages tokenization, contextual embeddings, and attention mechanisms to improve retrieval
accuracy.
• Implemented using transformers and PyTorch, it allows real-time question answering and enhances user
interaction

INTRODUCTION
Information Retrieval (IR) plays a crucial role in extracting relevant data from large text sources, enabling
efficient knowledge retrieval. Traditional IR systems rely on keyword-based searches, but modern advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) have enhanced their accuracy through semantic search and contextual understanding.
• This project focuses on developing a Question Answering (QA) System using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a deep learning model that improves information retrieval by understanding the context of user queries. Instead of providing a list of documents, the system directly extracts the most
relevant answer from structured and unstructured text.

MOTIVATION
With the rapid growth of digital information, efficiently retrieving relevant knowledge has become a
major challenge. Traditional keyword-based search systems often fail to understand context and
intent, leading to inaccurate or overwhelming results. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep
learning have revolutionized Information Retrieval (IR) by enabling machines to comprehend
human language more effectively
